This project is basically a calculator Made by C language
My first Mini-project (1st Semester) 

Project Name : Calculator Using C language


This is a simple calculator application written in the C programming language. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses if-else statements (instead of switch-case) for operation selection and handles user input using standard I/O functions. Designed for beginners learning C, this project demonstrates basic concepts like:

Conditional statements (if-else)
User input/output with scanf and printf
Arithmetic operations
Clearing the screen with system("cls") (Windows)



Key Feature :

1. Easy to use (using terminal)
2. Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication , Division between 2 intergers
3. History option using time fuction to save history
4. Delete history
